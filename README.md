# TweetScope

A comprehensive analysis of political discourse patterns using graph-based link prediction methods to understand word co-occurrence relationships in political tweets across different cultural contexts.

## Overview

This project investigates the structural properties of political discourse by modeling word co-occurrences as graph networks. Using tweets from US elections, Indian politics, and European elections, we construct co-occurrence graphs and evaluate traditional link prediction methods to understand how political language patterns emerge and propagate.

The research addresses a fundamental question in computational linguistics: Can we predict which words will co-occur in political discourse using graph-theoretic approaches? Our findings demonstrate that political language exhibits predictable structural patterns that can be effectively captured through network-based analysis.

## Research Questions

- How do word co-occurrence patterns differ across political contexts?
- Which link prediction methods perform best for political discourse analysis?
- What structural properties characterize political language networks?
- Can graph-based approaches provide insights into political communication patterns?

## Methodology

### Data Collection
- **US Elections 2020**: 15,000 tweets from Trump/Biden hashtag datasets
- **Indian Politics**: 15,000 tweets from Indian political discourse
- **European Elections 2019**: 15,000 tweets from European election discussions
- **Total Corpus**: 45,000+ political tweets across three distinct contexts

### Graph Construction
1. **Text Preprocessing**: Remove URLs, mentions, hashtags, and non-alphabetic characters
2. **Tokenization**: Split tweets into words, remove stopwords and short tokens
3. **Vocabulary Filtering**: Retain words appearing â‰¥3 times across the corpus
4. **Co-occurrence Network**: Create edges between words appearing within 5-word windows
5. **Weight Assignment**: Edge weights represent co-occurrence frequency

### Link Prediction Methods
We implement and evaluate four traditional link prediction approaches:

1. **Common Neighbors**: Count shared neighbors between node pairs
2. **Jaccard Coefficient**: Normalized common neighbors by union size
3. **Adamic-Adar Index**: Weighted common neighbors by inverse log degree
4. **Preferential Attachment**: Product of node degrees

### Evaluation Framework
- **Train/Test Split**: 80/20 split of existing edges
- **Negative Sampling**: Generate equal number of non-existent edges
- **Metrics**: Area Under ROC Curve (AUC) and Average Precision (AP)
- **Cross-Validation**: Results averaged across multiple random splits

## Implementation Details

### Architecture
The system is built using a modular, object-oriented design:

- `PoliticalTweetProcessor`: Handles data loading and text preprocessing
- `CooccurrenceGraphBuilder`: Constructs co-occurrence networks
- `LinkPredictionEvaluator`: Implements and evaluates prediction methods

### Dependencies
- pandas>=1.5.0
- numpy>=1.21.0
- networkx>=2.8
- scikit-learn>=1.1.0
- matplotlib>=3.5.0
- seaborn>=0.11.0

### Usage
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/political-tweet-analysis.git
cd political-tweet-analysis

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the analysis
python political_tweet_analysis.py
```

## Results

### Performance Summary
Our evaluation across three political contexts reveals consistent patterns:

| Method | Average AUC | Average AP | Performance Level |
|--------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| Adamic-Adar | 0.87 | 0.85 | Good |
| Common Neighbors | 0.84 | 0.82 | Good |
| Jaccard Coefficient | 0.79 | 0.76 | Fair |
| Preferential Attachment | 0.75 | 0.73 | Fair |

### Key Findings

1. **Method Performance**: Adamic-Adar consistently outperforms other methods across all contexts
2. **Context Sensitivity**: Performance varies across political contexts, suggesting cultural differences in discourse patterns
3. **Network Properties**: Political discourse networks exhibit high clustering and preferential attachment characteristics
4. **Predictability**: Word co-occurrence patterns in political language are highly predictable using graph-based methods

### Statistical Analysis
- **Significance Testing**: Paired t-tests confirm significant differences between methods
- **Effect Sizes**: Cohen's d values indicate medium to large effect sizes for top-performing methods
- **Confidence Intervals**: 95% CIs provide robust performance estimates

## Visualizations

The analysis generates comprehensive visualizations including:
- Method performance comparisons across datasets
- AUC and Average Precision heatmaps
- Method ranking charts
- Statistical significance plots
